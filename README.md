# Binary-Tree-leftchild-rightsib
A general tree class that allows each node to dominate an arbitrary number of child nodes. 
Each node links to its first child and right sibling (if they exist). 
Provided functions to insert and remove children from arbitrary nodes and to return the node containing a given piece of data.

$python tree.py
